"""
This script is designed to run on a PC to read emotion data from an OpenMV Cam H7 Plus via UART and
publish the detected emotions to an MQTT broker. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Lists available serial ports and selects the correct one for the OpenMV camera.
2. Initializes an MQTT client and connects to the specified MQTT broker.
3. Continuously reads emotion data from the serial port.
4. Publishes the detected emotions to the MQTT broker under the topic "ezan/emotion_detection".

Key functionalities:
- Serial communication with the OpenMV camera.
- MQTT communication to publish emotion data.
